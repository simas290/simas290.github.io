        <h1>Happy End of Days</h1>
        <p>Grettings fellow <strong>earth-dwellers!</strong>
        <br><br>
        By now you might be wondering why one would select such a topic for his holiday card. Well, the answer is <em>simple</em>:
        <br>
        This world is sick - poisoned by greed, corruption, exclusion,lust and anger. We are first and furmost, set out to improve "<strong>our lives</strong>, <br>anyone else is, at best, an <em>"optional objective"</em>. Let us not forget what we are doing to the earth our <em>one</em> and <strong>only home.</strong><br>
        I, among many individuals, am sick and tired of this degenerative cycle. Therefore, if opportunity arose, I'd like to :
        <ol>
           <ul> <strong>Release a virus that would wipe humanity off the face of the earth</strong></ul>
            <br>
            
            <ul><strong>Nuke us into oblivion</strong></ul> <br>
            
            <ul><strong>Burn as all alive</strong></ul>
            <br>
            <ul><strong>Stop us from reproducing like some kind of freakin' rabbits </strong></ul>
        </ol>
        <br>

        <h1>Reality of things</h1>
        <br>
        Now, if my <strong>HANDS WERE NOT TIED</strong> I Would provide an appropriate and graphic visualasation <br> of the aforementioned Apocalypse. Yet instead, I am forced to input an image from the "site-restricted google search". <br> However, despite this insult free speach and personal creativity, I will input an image here.<br><br>But every time you look at it just <strong>remember</strong>: <br> beyond its seemingly simple fasade lies such insurmountable rage and anger, that just a glimpse at its raw form would melt down your very soul.
